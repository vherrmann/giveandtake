# Feeds
Gratulations! You have probably opened your individual feed link (…/api/feed/…/…) just now in your web browser. Sadly you can't use a web browser to view this link. Instead, you have to use a feed reader. The feed reader will notify you about new posts, you just have to give it your feed link.

I can recommend the following feed readers:

- Mobile
    - Feeder: [:material-google-play:](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nononsenseapps.feeder.play), [:simple-fdroid:](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/)
    - feeeed: [:simple-apple:](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/feeeed-rss-reader-and-more/id1600187490)
- Desktop
    - [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/): (:simple-linux:, :material-microsoft-windows:, :material-apple:)
